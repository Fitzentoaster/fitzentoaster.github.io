            <p class="text-center">I love sports, football, and fantasy football particualrly. I've been playing fantasy sports since High School.
               I also love a good trainwreck. In traditional fantasy football, the object is to predict which NFL Players will perform
               at the highest level. I developed a system of playing Fantasy Football where the object is instead to predict
               which Quarterback and Defense will perform <i>the worst</i> any given week.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">Every year I run this game with three friends. And every year I've utilized technology to make my job
               easier and improve the player experience. In the early days, everything was done manually: weekly picks were texted to me
               and I manually calculated things like waiver priorities on paper in order to derive every player's resulting choices for the week
               and score was kept (and continues to be kept) on ESPN.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">I initially created the manager tool first in Java, to simplify my job. Then I created a tool
               in which the players could submit their weekly picks through the web.
               The project evolved from a simple command-line tool and barebones html form to its current incarnation, and continues to evolve every football season.
               I have plans to create a webapp that would allow others to get in on the fun
               and bring the fun of reverse-fantasy-football to the masses, but for now it remains a game between friends.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">Interesting note: I've wanted to somehow automate submission of picks to ESPN, but ESPN Fantasy Sports
               doesn't offer a public API or any tools to do so.
               For one season I created a tool using Selenium for browser automation
               to automatically submit choices to the ESPN server, but ESPSN dramatically overhauled their site midseason rendering my effort useless. 
               Perhaps we'll migrate to a more developer-friendly Fantasy Sports service in the future.
