               <p class="text-center">I have a lifelong love of gaming. In fact, I can credit my love of gaming as a child as one of the primary
                  factors that got me into the realm of computers and programming in the first place. I spent many long hours in my youth
                  creating small games in QBasic and a game-creation system called ZZT, which inspired the graphical style of Smuhley!
               </p>
               <p class="text-center">I have made a variety of small mobile games for fun but this was the first time I went the extra mile
                  and gave the game a fully-fledged release with deployment to the Google Play Store.
                  Let's just say <i>I learned a lot</i> from the experience: learning about deploying to the Google Play Store was nearly as complex
                  as creating the game itself! Optimizing the game for different devices was a tricky process: it's not the same as responsive web-design, that's for sure!
               </p>
               <p class="text-center">The game was created in GameMaker:Studio, utilizing the proprietary GML language. My education and experience
                  with object-oriented principles seriously comes in handy when developing in this environment. 
               </p>
               <p class="text-center">The game itself has not become particularly popular, but I consider it a success.
                  Fun sidenote: the game was originally going to be entitled "Sploot", but I discovered at the eleventh hour that another game
                  with that title exists, a VR game where you're a seagull that poops on stuff. No kidding.
