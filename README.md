### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Jake. 
I'm a software developer based in the Chicagoland area with a strong passion for coding and problem solving. After earning my Associate's degree in Computer Science in 2020, I've focused my expertise on C++ and Python, while also gaining experience with JavaScript, Java, PHP, and C through various courses and projects. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Software Development focus and a Mobile Programming Certificate at Northern Illinois University, supported by the Belong in STEM scholarship program with an expected graduation in December 2024.

Before transitioning into tech, I had diverse careers as a professional poker player and as a touring musician and music educator. This unique background and the variety of experiences that come with it enriches my approach to development, allowing me to tackle challenges from fresh perspectives and apply creative solutions.
